To connect to db(in this project we use mysql), create schema called js-project
with login:root and password:root. Table is called users with 3 field: email, name,password.

CREATE DATABASE js_project;

USE js_project;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  email VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  UNIQUE INDEX email_UNIQUE (email ASC) VISIBLE);

If you have such error:
"Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client"
then execute in mysql workbench this command:
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'
